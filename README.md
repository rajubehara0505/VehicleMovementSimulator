# VehicleMovementSimulator
A Python-based application demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), specifically focusing on inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. This repository contains a base Vehicle class with abstract methods, and several subclasses (Car, Bicycle, Boat) that implement the abstract move method in their own unique ways.
